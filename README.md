# Assignment 4

## Source Files Submitted:

Assignment4.py, Assignment4.sql

## Problems:
Had some troubles hooking up to GCP because of the coupon code. Tried using MySQL on my machine but was still having a lot of problems. Eventually was able to find the correct IPv4 to creat a database hosted on your GCP.


## Instruction on running program:

First run the 'CREATE TABLE' sql statements in Assignment4.sql as a block using highlighting and the green arrow.
Then, click the green arrow on the Asssignment4.py file and follow on screen instructions.
